Since the whole project is huge and complex, every time I wrote a piece of resume to describe this work, I don't even know how to describe.
Thus I just bought a domain name from Godaddy(DON'T BUY GODADDY'S HOSTING SERVICE, IT'S SUCK!!!) and hosting service from digitalocean, then launched the whole stuff.
Every one is free to use the code because it's all belong to me.
