These are homework of the course <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ateniese/courses/600.442/index.html">Modern Cryptography</a> and I finished them all with LATEX. I play LATEX for fun, though doing homework with it will consume quite a lot of time.
Anyway, please feel free to raise any recommendation which can help me improve my LATEX writing or cryptography studying.
