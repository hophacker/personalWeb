At the same time, we interact actively with company riskive’s API to evaluate the security and privacy issues of the social media. There are four key issues remained in this project, (1)how to bypass these restrictions, (2)how to make our crawler more efficient if some restrictions can’t be bypassed, (3)how to synchronize the work of distributed crawlers and (4)how to store data. To date, we have implemented a distributed crawler with the ability to crawl nearly 400,000 rows in one hour. This project involves a lot of work about Java, MySQL and python."
