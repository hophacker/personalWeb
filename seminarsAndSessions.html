	<li>Opening Remarks: What does cybersecurity mean to you, and what can you do to improve Cybersecurity?</li>
	<li>The cyber threat landscape is increasing in complexity, leaving organizations dangerously susceptible to attacks.</li>
	<li>The increased sophistication and complexity of cyber threats are also making it more difficult to counter the cyber-threat– exacerbated by a shortage of trained/skilled cyber professionals.</li>
	<li>Cybersecurity requires an Integrated Framework that sets forth the view that cyber is more than a “technology problem.”</li>
	<li>Further, Cyber Security requires a holistic approach incorporating People, Management, Policy, Operations, and Technology – at Booz Allen we call this an organization’s “Cyber Power.”</li>
	<li>The evolution of cybersecurity requires us to continually adjust our approach and the way we manage the risks from cyber-threats.</li>
	<li>The roles of cyber professionals can be grouped into 6 core areas that expand beyond the technology-related disciplines, enabling a broader approach to address the evolving set of cybersecurity needs.  </li>
	<li>In part, effective cybersecurity can be accomplished through these defined Cyber Roles and supporting how businesses hire, train, and staff for delivery of cyber professionals.</li>

<div class="abstract">
Cluster management is the term that Google uses to describe how we control the computing infrastructure in our datacenters that supports almost all of our external services.  It includes allocating resources to different applications on our fleet of computers, looking after software installations and hardware, monitoring, and many other things.  My goal is to present an overview of some of these systems, introduce Omega, the new cluster-manager tool we are building, and present some of the challenges that we're facing along the way.  Many of these challenges represent research opportunities, so I'll spend the majority of the time discussing those.

<div class="abstract">Boeing will be participating in a Technology and Recruiting Seminar session sponsored by Johns Hopkins University’s Information Security Institute. The hour and a half session will include a discussion on employment opportunities at Boeing as well as a presentation on Boeing’s information security business and capabilities.

In a world that is ever more dependent on cyber networks, connecting to such networks through computers and mobile devices carries potential security risks. Adversaries are constantly and aggressively seeking opportunities to exploit vulnerabilities of the virtual world to disrupt or inflict physical and financial damage. Hear how Boeing’s cybersecurity solutions help to guard against the endless stream of security threats our customers face every day and learn about new, innovative products currently being developed.

The format will be a 45-minute presentation followed by a 25-minute question and answer session with students and faculty.

<div class="event">The Password That Never Was
</div>
<div class="time"> Tuesday, October 22, 2013 at 10:45 a.m</div>
<div class="place">Hackerman Hall B-17</div>
<div class="abstract">Breaches of databases involving millions of passwords are becoming a commonplace threat to consumer security. Compromised passwords are also a feature of sophisticated targeted attacks, as the New York Times, for instance, reported of its own network intrusions early this year. The most common defense is password hashing. Hashing is the transformation of stored passwords using one-way functions that make verification of incoming passwords easy, but extraction of stored ones hard. “Hard,” though, often isn’t hard enough: Password cracking tools (such as “John the Ripper”) recover many hashed passwords quite effectively.

I’ll describe a new, complementary approach called honeywords (an amalgam of “honeypots” and “passwords”). Honeywords are decoys designed to be indistinguishable from legitimate passwords. When seeded in a password database, honeywords pose a challenge even to an adversary that compromises the database and cracks its hashed passwords. The adversary must still guess which passwords are legitimate, and is very likely to pick a honeyword instead. The adversary’s submission of a honeyword is detectable in a backend system, which can raise an alarm to signal a breach. I’ll also briefly discuss a related idea, called honey-encryption, which creates ciphertexts that decrypt under incorrect keys to seemingly valid (decoy) messages.

Honeywords and honey-encryption represent some of the first steps toward the principled use of decoys, a time-honored and increasingly important defense in a world of frequent, sophisticated, and damaging security breaches.

Honeywords are honey-encryption are joint work respectively with Ron Rivest (MIT) and Tom Ristenpart (U. Wisc).</div>

<div class="event">Bug Parades, Zombies, and the BSIMM: A Decade of Software Security</div>
<div class="time"> 1:30-2:45, October 21, Monday</div>
<div class="place">Maryland 109</div>
<div class="abstract">Only ten years ago, the idea of building security in was brand new. Back then, if system architects and developers thought about security at all, they usually concentrated on the liberal application of magic crypto fairy dust. We have come a long way since then. Perhaps no segment of the security industry has evolved more in the last decade than the discipline of software security. Several things happened in the early part of the decade that set in motion a major shift in the way people build software: the release of my book Building Secure Software, the publication of Bill Gates's Trustworthy Computing memo, the publication of Lipner and Howard’s Writing Secure Code, and a wave of high-profile attacks such as Code Red and Nimda that forced Microsoft, and ultimately other large software companies, to get religion about software security. Now, ten years later, Microsoft has made great strides in software security and building security in---and they’re publishing their ideas in the form of the SDL. Right about in the middle of the last ten years (five years in) we all collectively realized that the way to approach software security was to integrate security practices that I term the "Touchpoints" into the software development lifecycle. Now, at the end of a decade of great progress in software security, we have a way of measuring software security initiatives called the BSIMM <http://bsimm.com>. BSIMM is helping transform the field from an art into a measurable science. This talk provides an entertaining review of the software security journey from its "bug of the day" beginnings to the multi-million dollar software security initiatives of today.</div>
